# TP File Transfer

## Dev config on VSCode

**Install Flake8 (linter) and autopep 8 (formatter that follows PEP8 standard).** 
    Then, settings file should override format on save and added code should be compliant. 
    NOTE: Seems like formatter doesn't handle "too long" lines so the line jump should be added manually
